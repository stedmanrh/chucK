# Learn ChucK #
### What's ChucK? ###
<a href="http://chuck.stanford.edu/">ChucK</a> is a strongly-timed open-source music programming language for real-time sound synthesis and music creation.
### What's in this repo? ###
This repo consists of several projects undertaken for the purposes of learning audio programming with ChucK. They are all short composition assignments from a course I took at CalArts taught by Ajay Kapur called *Introduction to Programming for Musicians and Digital Artists.*
### Where can I listen to your tracks? ###
Exported audio can be found in the *bounces* directory. Listening to audio by actually executing .ck files is cooler because you get something a little bit different every time, but listening to an .m4a file in *bounces* is a quick and convenient way to hear just one possible outcome without the need to first install ChucK.
### Audio programming sounds fun! How do I learn? ###
Shortly after finishing the course, I joined a coalition of talented artists, creatives, and technologists to create an <a href="http://kadenze.com">online platform for world-class education</a> in the fields of art and creative technology. You can now <a href="https://www.kadenze.com/courses/introduction-to-programming-for-musicians-and-digital-artists-iii/info">learn ChucK **for free** from the minds who created and maintain it</a> on Kadenze.
